Sample command line:
/p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/pin -t /p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db 64 -- yourexe

Replace "yourexe" with the name of your executable.

For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	693
	Instruction cache references:	695491
	Data cache misses:		107204
	Data cache references:		646457

1.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

			83.42%


2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	696
	Instruction cache references:	695491
	Data cache misses:		15316
	Data cache references:		646457

2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

			97.63%


3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	688
	Instruction cache references:	695491
	Data cache misses:		8684
	Data cache references:		646457

3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

			98.66%


4. (to be answered without running pin)
   For this question, assume that the 100,000 elements long integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory,
   the size of an integer is 4 bytes  and the D-cache is initially empty. 
   As you READ the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, 
   how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is:
   a) 4 bytes: 40
   b) 32 bytes: 5
   c) 64 bytes: 3

5. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
   size affect the hit ratio for this program?
  
	A block size of 64 is best for the D-cache because it has a better
	hit ratio than the other block sizes. Clearly larger block sizes lead
	to better hit ratios for this program.

6.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	697
	Instruction cache references:	16616511
	Data cache misses:		118157
	Data cache references:		12061460

6.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

			99.02%

cache2Dcols
-----------

7.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

	Instruction cache misses:	697
	Instruction cache references:	16599011
	Data cache misses:		1507522
	Data cache references:		12048960

7.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

			87.49%

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------
8. (to be answered without running pin) 
    For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory,
    the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty.
    As you READ the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0],
    how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of:
    a) cache2Drows:
    b) cache2Dcols:

9. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 6 and 7.
    Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".

	There is a major difference in performance because
