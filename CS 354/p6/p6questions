Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

% intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds.
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:21 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:24 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:27 2015
^C

How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statements?

The alarm set before the infinite while loop in Main() sends an alarm signal to the program after the set time (3 seconds). This signal causes an exceptional control flow causing the process to invoke the user defined signal handler which in this case prints the statements despite the infinite while loop being empty.
