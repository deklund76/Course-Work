Both the written section and the program have to do with using and implementing different search algorithms.

In this problem, you are one of the officers in the Zootopia Police Department. Write a Java program to find a path through the city from a given start position to a given goal position to solve conflicts. A city map will be given in a text file as a matrix in which the start position is indicated by “S”, the goal position is indicated by “G”, walls are indicated by “%”. Only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed, not diagonal.

Implemented path search with both Depth First Search as well as A* search.
