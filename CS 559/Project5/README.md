2 sets of fragment and vertex shaders written in GLSL

BasicFirelit shaders: These basic shaders have two light sources, one for ambient lighting (actually implemented as diffuse facing opposite the other light source) giving a deep blue nighttime feel, and the other offering a warm light from a fireplace.

Iridescent Shaders: The fancy shaders mimic a surface that is iridescent (e.g. oil).
